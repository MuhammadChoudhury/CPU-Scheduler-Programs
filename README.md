# CPU-Scheduler-Programs
Created programs that simulate how processes enter and leave CPUs. Each programs follows the three different CPU scheduling algorithms

1. FCFS follows the First Come First Server algorithm 
2. SJF follows the Shortest Job First algorithm
3. MLFQ follows the Multilevel Feedback Queue which has three queues: Round-Robin with a time quantum of 5, Round-Robin with a time quantum of 10, FCFS
